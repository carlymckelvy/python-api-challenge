# python-api-challenge

Inlcuded in this repository are folders for the WeatherPy and VacationPy portions of the Python API project.  Each of these folders contains a jupyter notebook file with the main scripts, as well as the checkpoints, and an output file containing the plots created within each of these analyses.  Additionally, there are written descriptions of observable trends throughout the WeatheyPy notebook.
